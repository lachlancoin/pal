This is the place where the current version of PAL (as found in the CVS repository) should
appear about once every week or two. Be warned that not everything might not work (but it should), and that
your code may be broken if it relies on previous APIs. The javadoc pages are not included in the file. And sorry about it
being a zip with windows line endings.
